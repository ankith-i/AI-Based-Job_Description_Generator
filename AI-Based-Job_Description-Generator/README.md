## Setting Things Up

To commence your journey with this project, first get the development server humming:

\```bash
npm run dev
# Alternatively, you can use:
yarn dev
# or even:
pnpm dev
\```

Once the server's heart is beating, direct your web browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to catch a glimpse of the live application.

Feel an itch to mold the application to your liking? Dive straight into the codebase. Begin with `pages/index.js`. And fret not, every change you make breathes life into the page instantly, thanks to the real-time auto-updating feature.

If you're venturing into the realms of API, our [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) are waiting to greet you at [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). To sprinkle your own magic on this endpoint, the wand you need is located at `pages/api/hello.js`.

A special note for the curious souls: the `pages/api` directory is the mystical land where `/api/*` paths are born. Here, files don't transform into the usual React pages; they dawn the mantle of [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction).

Another feather in this project's cap is its incorporation of [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization). This charm automatically refines and beckons 'Inter', a distinctive Google Font, enhancing user experience.
